1. How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me strengthen my skills in modular scene design, texture mapping, and lighting management. I learned how to construct complex 3D scenes using basic primitives combined with accurate transformations.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I used an iterative design process. I first built the basic scene structure, then refined the object positioning, added materials, and adjusted lighting progressively based on test renders.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Building a modular scene where objects are easy to manage, transform, and texture can be applied in larger 3D projects, simulation environments, and even game development workflows.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I applied modular coding practices by using helper functions like SetTransformations() and SetShaderTexture() to minimize repetition and increase code reusability.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was critical. After each build, I adjusted object scaling, rotation, lighting strength, and object placement to fine-tune the scene to match the reference and correct rendering issues.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I moved from basic object placement to creating a more organized, reusable, and readable structure. I focused more on making my code scalable and easy to modify by separating scene objects and using modular functions.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Learning computational graphics builds a strong understanding of 3D coordinate systems, transformations, and rendering pipelines, which are valuable in fields like simulation development, gaming, and interactive software.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
3D visualization skills can be applied professionally in cybersecurity visualization tools, data analysis dashboards, game development, and cloud-based 3D simulations, especially as industries continue to rely more on immersive technologies.
